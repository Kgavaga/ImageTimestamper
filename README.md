# ImageTimestamper
This little python script can insert timestamps into images. 

It uses an Image Library named Pillow.
For more infos go to: https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html

For that reason it is essential to ensure that you have the latest version
of Pillow. With the following two commands you are able to ensure that have
the latest version.

python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install --upgrade Pillow
(In reference to https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html)

The script contains three different functions to serve similar yet slightly
different needs. More infos can be found in the code itself.
Have fun!
